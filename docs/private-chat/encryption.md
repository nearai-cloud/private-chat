# User Data Encryption in Open WebUI

## Overview

This Open WebUI fork implements **end-to-end per-user data encryption** to ensure complete privacy of user conversations and sensitive data. The encryption system is designed with **zero-knowledge architecture** where even developers, cloud infrastructure providers, or the Phala Network cannot access or decrypt user chat data.

## Why This Implementation Protects User Data

### Core Security Principles

1. **Per-User Encryption Keys**: Each user has a unique AES-256-GCM encryption key
2. **External Key Management**: Encryption keys are managed by Phala's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
3. **Zero-Knowledge Design**: No plaintext user data is stored or transmitted
4. **Transparent Encryption**: All chat data is encrypted/decrypted transparently without user intervention
5. **Graceful Fallback**: System maintains backward compatibility with existing unencrypted data
6. **🔒 Complete TEE Deployment**: **CRITICAL** - The entire application stack (frontend, backend, database, key service) runs inside Phala's Trusted Execution Environment

### Security Guarantees

- **Developers cannot access user data**: All chat content is encrypted before storage
- **Cloud providers cannot read conversations**: Data is encrypted at the application layer
- **Phala Network cannot steal data**: TEE-based key service operates in secure enclaves
- **Database compromises are mitigated**: Encrypted data is useless without decryption keys
- **Forward secrecy**: Each user's key is unique and independently managed
- **🛡️ Frontend Protection**: Unlike traditional web applications, the frontend code itself runs in the TEE, preventing client-side compromises
- **Hardware-Level Security**: The entire stack is protected by Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone hardware security

## Architecture

### High-Level Flow

```
User Chat -> Application -> Encryption Layer -> Database (Encrypted)
                    |
                    v
            Phala Key Service (TEE)
```

### Components

1. **Chat Encryption Proxy** (`chat_encryption_proxy.py`)
   - Transparent wrapper around existing chat operations
   - Handles encryption/decryption without modifying core chat logic
   - Provides fallback mechanisms for error handling

2. **User Encryption Service** (`user_encryption.py`)
   - Core encryption/decryption functionality
   - AES-256-GCM implementation with secure random nonces
   - Key caching and management

3. **Phala Key Service** (External TEE)
   - Secure key generation and storage
   - TEE-based key decryption service
   - Hardware-protected key operations

## Technical Implementation

### Encryption Specification

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Authenticated Encryption)
- **Key Size**: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- **Nonce Size**: 96 bits (12 bytes) - randomly generated per operation
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication with GCM mode
- **Encoding**: Base64 for storage compatibility

### Data Flow

#### Encryption Process
1. User submits chat data
2. System retrieves/generates user's encryption key from Phala KMS
3. Chat data is serialized to JSON
4. AES-256-GCM encrypts data with random nonce
5. Encrypted data (nonce + ciphertext) is base64 encoded
6. Encrypted blob is stored in database

#### Decryption Process
1. System retrieves encrypted data from database
2. Base64 decodes the encrypted blob
3. Extracts nonce (first 12 bytes) and ciphertext
4. Retrieves user's decryption key from Phala KMS (with caching)
5. AES-256-GCM decrypts data using nonce and key
6. JSON is parsed and returned to user

### Key Management Architecture

#### Phala Key Service Integration

The system integrates with Phala's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for secure key management:

```yaml
# Docker Compose Configuration
services:
  key-service:
    image: danielwpz/seal-cvm:0.5
    volumes:
      - /var/run/dstack.sock:/var/run/dstack.sock
    
  private-chat:
    environment:
      ENABLE_CHAT_ENCRYPTION: true
      KEY_SERVICE_BASE_URL: http://key-service:3001
```

#### Key Lifecycle

1. **Key Generation**: When a user first needs encryption, a new key is generated by Phala KMS
2. **Key Storage**: Encrypted key is stored in the database (`user_data_keys` table)
3. **Key Retrieval**: Keys are decrypted on-demand by the TEE service
4. **Key Caching**: Decrypted keys are cached in memory for performance
5. **Key Rotation**: Keys can be rotated through the KMS interface

### Transparent Proxy Implementation

The `ChatTableEncryptionProxy` class wraps all database operations:

```python
class ChatTableEncryptionProxy(ChatTable):
    def insert_new_chat(self, user_id: str, form_data: ChatForm):
        # Encrypts chat data before storage
        self._store_encrypted_chat(chat_record, form_data.chat, user_id)
        
    def get_chat_by_id(self, id: str):
        # Decrypts chat data after retrieval
        return self._create_chat_model_from_db_record(db_record)
```

### Security Features

#### Encryption Configuration
- **Environment Variable**: `ENABLE_CHAT_ENCRYPTION=true`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Handles both encrypted and plaintext data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to unencrypted storage on encryption failures

#### Data Protection
- **Chat Content**: All message history and metadata
- **Chat Titles**: Encrypted separately for additional privacy
- **User Metadata**: Any sensitive user-specific information

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Key Caching**: In-memory caching of decrypted keys
- **Lazy Loading**: Keys are only fetched when needed
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple chat operations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable per-user encryption
ENABLE_CHAT_ENCRYPTION=true

# Phala Key Management Service URL
KEY_SERVICE_BASE_URL=http://key-service:3001

# Database configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
```

### Deployment with Phala Network

**🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY FEATURE**: The system is designed to run **entirely within Phala's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**. This is fundamentally different from traditional cloud deployments:

```yaml
services:
  key-service:
    image: danielwpz/seal-cvm:0.5
    container_name: key-service
    volumes:
      - /var/run/dstack.sock:/var/run/dstack.sock
    restart: unless-stopped

  private-chat:
    image: danielwpz/private-chat:0.4
    container_name: private-chat
    environment:
      ENABLE_CHAT_ENCRYPTION: true
      KEY_SERVICE_BASE_URL: http://key-service:3001
```

**Why TEE Deployment Matters:**
- **Complete Isolation**: Both services run in hardware-protected enclaves
- **Frontend Security**: Unlike web apps where frontend code runs on user devices, the entire UI runs in the TEE
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: No component of the system is exposed to untrusted environments
- **Hardware Attestation**: Users can cryptographically verify the code running in the TEE
- **Memory Protection**: All application memory is encrypted and protected from host OS access

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

**Protected Against:**
- Database breaches (data is encrypted at rest)
- Cloud provider surveillance (application-layer encryption)
- Insider threats (zero-knowledge design)
- Network interception (encrypted data transmission)
- **🔒 Client-side compromises**: **UNLIKE traditional web apps**, the frontend runs in the TEE, not on user devices
- **🔒 Host OS compromises**: TEE provides hardware isolation from the host operating system
- **🔒 Infrastructure attacks**: The entire stack is protected by hardware security modules

**Minimal Attack Surface:**
- Memory dumps while keys are cached (within TEE only)
- Side-channel attacks on the TEE hardware (mitigated by Phala's security measures)
- **Physical hardware attacks** (would require sophisticated nation-state capabilities)

## Privacy Guarantees

This implementation ensures that:

- **User conversations remain private** even with full database access
- **Developers cannot read user content** during development or debugging
- **Cloud infrastructure providers** cannot access plaintext data
- **Phala Network operators** cannot decrypt user data (TEE protection)
- **Regulatory compliance** is enhanced through privacy-by-design architecture

The combination of AES-256-GCM encryption, per-user keys, and TEE-based key management creates a robust privacy protection system that maintains the zero-knowledge principle throughout the entire data lifecycle.

## Migration and Compatibility

The system is designed for seamless integration:

- **Backward Compatible**: Existing unencrypted chats continue to work
- **Progressive Encryption**: New chats are automatically encrypted when enabled
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to unencrypted storage on encryption failures
- **No User Action Required**: Encryption/decryption happens transparently

This ensures that privacy-conscious users can benefit from strong encryption without disrupting existing workflows or requiring data migration.
